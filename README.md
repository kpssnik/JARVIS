# JARVIS
Listener program for executing voice commands such as: Open/Close program e.t.c with user control

The first interesting application in my C# career. In november I suddenly discovered libraries for voice input/output and decided to create some kind of Jarvis from Iron Man. The first idea was ask-answer system, but the next day I decided to deploy PC voice control system. 

The first version did not contain any user settings and it could understand only my included russian commands. 
But later there was an update where I have deployed a flexible setting system. User can input needed commands himself and binds for open programs. 

My Jarvis is very simple in using - you press start, Jarvis is waiting for summon word (user controlled) and starts listening the command. You can ask him to start/close called program (example - "Jarvis... Open browser", and it will open user-set browser.). In addition to this it can stop listening your commands, shutdown and shutdown your PC after the confirmation.
